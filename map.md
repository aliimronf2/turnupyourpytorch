# This is the outline of this code

Machine learning is best for structured data, e.g use XGBoost.
Deep learning is best for unstructured data, e.g neural network.

Machine learning algorithm:
- Random forest
- Gradient boosted models
- Naive Bayes
- Nearest neighbour
- Support vector machine

Deep learning
- Neural networks
- Fully connected neural network
- Convolutional neural network
- Recurrent neural network
- Transformer

Deep learning actual use case
- Recommendation
- Translation (seq2seq)
- Speech recognition (seq2seq)
- Computer vision (classification/regression)
- Natural Language Processing (classification/regression)

**Pytorch**
1. Pytorch basics and fundamental
2. Preprocessing data
3. Building and using pretrained deep learning models
    1. Pick a loss function and optimizer
    2. Build a training loop
4. Fitting a model to the data (learning patters)
5. Making predictions with a model (using patterns)
6. Evaluating model prediction
7. Saving and loading models
8. Using a trained model to make predictions on custom data
